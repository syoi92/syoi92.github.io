Some examples of these maintenance tasks are mowing the landscape of highway areas, detecting debris, patching unfilled holes in the pavement, and identifying and repairing road signs. This study will develop a framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) image acquisition with image segmentation methods to automate the tasks needed to effectively maintain highway infrastructure. Existing research for UAV-based environment monitoring has limitations in the number of datasets relevant for highway monitoring and did not comprehensively analyze the effect of changing flight parameters. To overcome these limitations, the proposed research investigates the effect of flight parameters on UAV semantic segmentation performance by considering images taken from varying UAV heights and both vertical and oblique camera angles. This research uses a deep neural network based on U-Net to automatically processes the images and segments them into different regions. Efficient training data annotation is also carried out by performing large-scale ground truth annotation through automatic co-labeling of images and point cloud data. Validation experiments were performed on a real highway dataset, showing that while the segmentation performance varies by 3-25% depending on the flight height, the performance only varies by 0.5% depending on the camera angle.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of Flight Parameters on UAV Semantic Segmentation Performance for Highway Infrastructure Monitoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yosuke Yajima","Mark Kahoush","Seongyong Kim","Jingdao Chen","Jisoo Park","Steven Kangisser","Javier Irizarry","Yong K.

Examples of these maintenance tasks include landscaping and lawn care, detecting damaged road segments, and identifying missing road signs. While several infrastructure monitoring methods have been proposed, many of them are only carried out using 2D images and do not fully utilize the 3D geometric information in the scene. Additionally, most methods often downscale the data and did not consider the fine resolution needed for inspection tasks. To efficiently automate the maintenance inspection tasks, this research proposes a new approach that combines a data collection framework using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data processing techniques. Structure from Motion (SfM) is used to create dense 3D point clouds from image data and deep learning techniques are used to segment and classify different highway assets. Point cloud-based temporal change detection is carried out with a focus on grass height estimation for monitoring highway mowing operations. A field highway dataset is collected to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the method achieved 93% semantic segmentation accuracy and 6.31 cm root mean square error (RMSE) in grass height estimation.","tags":[],"title":"AI-driven 3D Point Cloud-Based Highway Infrastructure Monitoring System using UAV","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seongyong Kim","Seula Park","Hyeonjeong Kim","Kiyun Yu"],"categories":["Indoor"],"content":"","date":1616227677,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608832614,"objectID":"fec536b414865492e18d9f7791eafb8d","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/publication/2020-cpeng/","publishdate":"2021-03-20T17:07:57+09:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-cpeng/","section":"publication","summary":"Keywords: Indoor Spaces; Floor Plan Analysis; Style Transfer; Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN); Integer Programming\n\n*Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering*, Volume 35 Issue 2 - March 2021","tags":[],"title":"Deep Floor Plan Analysis for Complicated Drawings Based on Style Transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Indoor"],"content":"Floorplan Analysis: retriving the indoor structure from floorplans https://github.com/IndoorProject\n","date":1605859207,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606102726,"objectID":"4fbaa94bf3edd515f92bf778e8632f55","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/2020-indoor/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T17:00:07+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/2020-indoor/","section":"project","summary":"Floorplan Analysis: retriving the indoor structure from floorplans","tags":["selected","recent"],"title":"Indoor Reconstruction [Korea MOLIT, Jul. 2017 – Dec. 2020]","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605859029,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606102726,"objectID":"bcf878002f3c8a2792d5906f45b4434f","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/2018-dronesurvey/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T16:57:09+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/2018-dronesurvey/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["past","gis"],"title":"GIS- DroneSurvey [Seoul SROCM, Jun.–Jul. 2018]","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605858975,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606102726,"objectID":"a2bc4cb128c43e16c25bab2c96508c9e","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/2017-unauthorizedland/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T16:56:15+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/2017-unauthorizedland/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["past","gis"],"title":"GIS- UnauthorizedLand [Korea LX, Jul.–Oct. 2017]","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605858820,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606102726,"objectID":"ba610d462e34721c9becbc53fdf25229","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/2017-address/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T16:53:40+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/2017-address/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["past","gis"],"title":"GIS- Advanced Address System [Korea MOI, Jul.-Dec. 2017]","type":"project"},{"authors":["Seongyong Kim"],"categories":["GIS"],"content":"","date":1605849655,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608848719,"objectID":"b7c03e3d6745e0dbe6f8554aafb67698","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/2020-seri/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T14:20:55+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/2020-seri/","section":"project","summary":"GIS consulting based on open source software (QGIS)","tags":["recent","gis"],"title":"GIS- Consulting Location Allocation as an Adversory Researcher [Samsung Economic Research Institute, May–Jun. 2020]","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["startup"],"content":"http://118.67.128.236\n","date":1605772743,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609533351,"objectID":"b034ae90d7a7198ec3ecbbf2d78df7ee","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/startup-sizac/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T16:59:03+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/startup-sizac/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by *Korea Ministry of SMEs and Startups*; a MVP will be ready by Jan. 2021","tags":["startup"],"title":"Startup- recommending starting locations to new business owners","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["GIS"],"content":"With the perspective of automation, we perform discrepancy analysis for detecting parcels that should be updated using hyperspectral UAV images.\n  An up-to-date land cover map is generated from hyperspectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

A discrepancy map, which contains the ratio of the area that is being used differently from the registered land use in each parcel, is constructed through a three-stage inconsistency comparison.  The method automatically reveals the inconsistent parcels requiring updates of their land category. Although the performance of the proposed method depends on the classification results obtained from UAV imagery, the method allows a flexible modification of the matching criteria between the land categories and land coverage. Therefore, it is generalizable to various cadastral systems and the discrepancy ratios will provide practical information and significantly reduce the time and effort for land monitoring and field surveying.\n","date":1605763285,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606102726,"objectID":"36008c5c000ff4739202035b0b22dfdf","permalink":"https://syoi92.github.io/project/2019-landcover/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T14:21:25+09:00","relpermalink":"/project/2019-landcover/","section":"project","summary":"Cadastral Map;
